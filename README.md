# Password Generator Starter Code

Prompts are presented to the user when the Generate Password button is pressed to decide characters and length in password.

Based on the selections picked by the user an array of characters is created to choose from to create user password.

The number of characters the user chose is the number of random characters pulled from the array.

The new array created by the random characters is then stringified and presented on the screen as the new password for the user.

The user can recreate the password as many times as they would like until satisfied.
